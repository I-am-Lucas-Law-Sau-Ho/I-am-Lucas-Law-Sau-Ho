👋 Hi, I’m @I-am-Lucas-Law-Sau-Ho! I'm a passionate coder who loves to explore new technologies and develop exciting projects. In this document, I will provide more information about my interests and experience.



👀 I am interested in coding. I love to write code and solve complex problems using programming. My passion for coding started when I was in college, and since then, I have been exploring various programming languages and frameworks.


🌱 I am currently learning how to use Tensorflow in Python. Tensorflow is a powerful machine learning library that is widely used in the field of artificial intelligence. I find it fascinating to learn about how machine learning algorithms work, and I am excited to use Tensorflow to develop my own projects.


💞️ I am looking to collaborate with a game, bank company or professors in Chinese University of Hong Kong. I believe that working with a company or university in these fields will allow me to apply my skills to develop innovative solutions that can make a positive impact on people's lives.


📫 If you are interested in collaborating with me or have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me via email at lucaslawsauho@gmail.com. I look forward to hearing from you!
